# Health Care Disease Prediction

This project involves developing a machine learning model to predict diseases based on symptoms.

## Files

- `dataset.csv`: Contains the dataset of symptoms and diseases.
- `disease_description.csv`: Provides descriptions for various diseases.
- `disease_precaution.csv`: Lists precautions for each disease.
- `symptom_severity.csv`: Details the severity of different symptoms.
- `health_care_disease_predict.py`: Python script to preprocess the data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and train the machine learning model.

## Getting Started
